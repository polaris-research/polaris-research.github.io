    "text": "Project Overview\nDemocracy and political culture in the Western world are under threat, marked by growing polarization, the erosion of democratic values, and the disintegration of public discourse in the digital age. This crisis is exemplified by the rise and disproportionate success of the global New Right. Social media platforms like TikTok, X, and Facebook play a pivotal role in this transformation, reshaping not only the dynamics of political communication but also undermining fundamental democratic principles.\nBy amplifying extreme voices and prioritizing engagement-driven content—often fueled by emotional and polarizing rhetoric—these platforms actively reshape public discourse. Our project argues that this disruption contributes to an “unlearning” of democracy, where citizens become habituated to emotionalized and antagonistic forms of discourse, undermining rational deliberation.\nTo analyze what we conceive as democratic erosion, we build on an interdisciplinary theoretical framework that combines two complementary perspectives:\n\nThe Democratic Erosion Triad: We examine the erosion of the public sphere through three interconnected processes: radicalization, mainstreaming, and political polarization.\nPlatform Theory & Multimodality: We consider these social processes in the context of platform theory, social media affordances, and the power of multimodal communication (text, images, video, audio) to shape how users experience and respond to political messages.\n\n\n\n\nOur Approach\nThis project uses an explanatory mixed-methods design to ensure robust and validated findings. Our methodology combines:\n\nContinuous Content Collection: Systematic, large-scale collection of TikTok data to create a comprehensive and scalable content database.\nComputational & Multimodal Content Analysis: Using AI-driven analytics, computer vision, and NLP to analyze textual, visual, and auditory elements of content at scale.\nQualitative Analysis: In-depth interpretive analysis of multimodal content to understand narrative strategies, framing, and symbolic meaning.\nNetwork Analysis: Mapping the structure and dynamics of right-wing networks on TikTok to identify key actors, content diffusion, and community clusters.\nSurvey Experiments & Focus Groups: Investigating the impact of far-right content on audience perceptions, emotions, and attitudes towards democracy through controlled experiments and qualitative discussions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Beyond Anti-Elitism and Out-Group Attacks: How Concerns Shape the AfD’s Populist Representation on German TikTok During the 2024 European Elections\n  \n    H. Meyer, J. Niemann-Lenz, L. Rodeck, and M. Revers\n    -\n    \n  \n  \n    A study of the German right-wing populist party AfD's TikTok usage during the 2024 European elections reveals a strategic focus on user concerns over traditional divisive rhetoric. Analyzing video transcripts from the three months preceding the election, the study found that while anti-institutional and protectionist themes were present, content addressing issues like inflation, security, and individual rights garnered significantly higher engagement. This approach, which outperformed all other German parties combined, suggests the AfD effectively broadened its appeal by prioritizing relatable anxieties. By blending polarizing content with everyday worries, the party successfully engaged a wider audience, raising new questions about effective online populist communication.\n  \n  Read Publication\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
